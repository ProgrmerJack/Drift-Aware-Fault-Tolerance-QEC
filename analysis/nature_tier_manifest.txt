NATURE COMMUNICATIONS REPORTING SUMMARY - STATISTICS

1. STATISTICAL UNIT
   Unit of analysis: day-backend session
   n = 42 sessions (not shots/circuits)
   Clusters: 42 day-backend combinations

2. PRIMARY ENDPOINT
   Comparison: Drift-aware vs Baseline static selection
   Effect estimate: -0.000201 (reduction in logical error rate)
   95% CI: [-0.000217, -0.000185]
   Method: Cluster-robust bootstrap (10,000 iterations)
   P-value: 0.0000 (cluster permutation test)
   
3. EFFECT SIZES
   Cohen's d: -3.821 (large)
   Relative risk reduction: 60.7%

4. NEGATIVE CONTROLS
   - drift_benefit_correlation: PASS: More drift → more improvement (r=0.663, p=0.000)
   - probe_benefit_test: Note: Probes may not be utilized (r=-0.219)
   - wrong_target_placebo: PASS: No effect on placebo

5. HOLDOUT VALIDATION
   - temporal (Days 8-14): Generalizes
   - backend (ibm_brisbane): Generalizes
   - backend (ibm_kyoto): Generalizes
   - backend (ibm_osaka): Generalizes

6. MECHANISM ANALYSIS
   Drift → Failure: r = 0.659
   Treatment reduces drift sensitivity: effect = 0.000045, p = 0.3270

7. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
   Pre-registered design: 14 days × 3 backends
   Achieved: 42 paired comparisons
   Power: >99% for medium effect (d = 0.5) at α = 0.05
   
8. EXCLUSIONS
   None - all runs included
   Excluded: 0 runs

9. TWO-SIDED TESTS
   All tests are two-sided (per pre-registration)
